===========

An Arduino Leonardo forms the basis of this time-saving tool to automate keystrokes.

This is an easy, easy project.... use button inputs to an Arduino Leonardo to send commands such as Ctrl-C
and Ctrl-V, making it easier to quickly write code.  I plan on adding foot pedals as inputs as well to enable
me to always have one hand on the keyboard and one on the mouse.
